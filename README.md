Hi, there! This mini game is created as part of learning JavaScript DOM and events fundamentals in the Udemy course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert! by Jonas Schmedtmann. I have written the codes while following Jonas' lectures and demos. You may also enjoy seeing (or playing) it through the link below! 😁
